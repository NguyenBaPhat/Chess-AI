Lecturer in charge: Trần Nhật Quang.

## Introduction

The project aims to create a chess engine with interactive GUI for educational purposes as an example of searching algorithms in turn-based game.

## Methodology

We build the project with the basis of adversarial searching algorithms, specifically Alpha-Beta Pruning Searching, a variant of minimax with conditions to prune the bad branches. Our evaluation method is based on the pieces value system of 1-3-3-5-9, the importance of controlled squares, the King's safety, the position of Rook, the mobility of Queen, Knight and Bishop.

## Functionalities

The program provides the user with an easy-to-use GUI and a chess engine to play with. Players can form their own state and then ask the engine to join.

## Installation Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or up.
- PySimpleGUI package.
- NumPy, Python-Chess, Math libraries
